An AI react app for chat bot

<img src='https://github.com/Mayank-141-Shaw/AI-Chat-App/blob/main/shots/chat-app.png' alt='Chat App' />

This app was created using reactjs and python flask microservice to provide a complete chat solution

The frontend made of reactJS is used to build the UI for interacting with the bot, and the python microservice consumes the request messages and provides accurate responses based on the data it has for reference and it s trained for.

To run this project, we must build the two seperate projects in python and react folder, and start both the services on either localhost or any other host of your choice where you would upload them, and they should run just fine. Cheers!

P.S. Follow the readme.txt file in python service for starting up the flask app.
